# Professional README Generator


## Description
This script will generate a README file and automatically format it. It is designed to be quick and easy to use so that you don't have to code a new README file every time you start writing a program. The program will take user input and output it to a new README.md file that will be located at the same place where main.sh is. This README file is the first one I have generated using the program! Some of the sections below that are not filled in manually show the raw output such as the badge section, and the Table of Contents sectionwhich doesn't need to exist here because it is a short README.


## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#License)


## Installation
To install the program, clone the repository and then just run the ./main.sh in any CLI.

## Badges
Badges are an important part of READMEs's, Unfortunately they are not yet supported by this project.

## Tests
[INSERT TEST CASES HERE] 
The line above is what is automatically generated by the program. The great thing about testing this program is that it is all based on user input, so your test cases can be easily created by manipulating your responses when you run the program.
